                Emily Dickinson, in full Emily Elizabeth Dickinson, (born December 10, 1830, Amherst, Massachusetts, U.S.—died May 15, 1886,
                Amherst), American lyric poet who lived in seclusion and commanded a singular brilliance of style and integrity
                of vision. With Walt Whitman, Dickinson is widely considered to be one of the two leading 19th-century American
                poets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only 10 of Emily Dickinson’s nearly 1,800 poems are known to have been published in her lifetime. Devoted to private pursuits,
                she sent hundreds of poems to friends and correspondents while apparently keeping the greater number to herself.
                She habitually worked in verse forms suggestive of hymns and ballads, with lines of three or four stresses.
                Her unusual off-rhymes have been seen as both experimental and influenced by the 18th-century hymnist Isaac
                Watts. She freely ignored the usual rules of versification and even of grammar, and in the intellectual content
                of her work she likewise proved exceptionally bold and original. Her verse is distinguished by its epigrammatic
                compression, haunting personal voice, enigmatic brilliance, and lack of high polish.
